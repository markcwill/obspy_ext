# These are modules and extensions for using the ObsPy framework.
# Some are in production shape and have good documentation, and
# most likely others with more beta status will be added later.
#
# See READMEs of individual modules for an overview and any
# requirements they might have, for example, need Lindquist's
# python API for antelope in order to use the 'antelope' mod.
