## Obspy extension modules

**Note:** Now that ObsPy is on GitHub, I'm probaby going to implement most of these and future extensions in my own fork of ObsPy. They will be incorporated in my master branch, and/or be in their own branches of my fork. Please check there for the latest updates. This repo may be maintained as a test bed... 

These are modules and extensions for using the ObsPy framework. Some are in production shape and have good documentation, and most likely others with more beta status will be added later.

See READMEs of individual modules for an overview and any requirements they might have, for example, need Lindquist's python API for antelope in order to use the 'antelope' mod.
